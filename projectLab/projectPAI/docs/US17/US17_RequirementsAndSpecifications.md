- **Progamme Edition Enrolment:** Represents the enrolment of a student in a specific programme edition.

- **Course Edition:** Represents an edition/instance of a curricular unit within a programme edition.

- **Course Edition Enrolment:** Represents the enrolment of a student in a specific course edition.



### 8. Event Flow

- The ASC initiates the enrolment process for a student in a specific programme edition.

- The system prompts the ASC to provide the student’s identifier.

- The system presents a list of available programmes, and the ASC selects one.

- The system presents a list of school years, and the ASC selects one.

- The system verifies if the student is already enrolled in the selected programme.

- The system finds the corresponding programme edition for the selected programme and school year.

- The system verifies if the student is already enrolled in that programme edition.

- The system identifies the course editions linked to the selected programme edition.

- The system completes the enrolment and displays a success message confirming the student's enrolment in the programme 
and course editions.



### 9. Testing and Validation


- **T1:** Test student not enrolle in programme

Ensure that the system correctly identifies and rejects enrolment attempts when the student entity is not enrolled in programme.


- **T2:** Test programme edition not found

Ensure that the system correctly identifies and rejects enrolment attempts when the programme edition not found.

- **T3:** Test student already enrolled in programme edition

Ensure that the system correctly identifies and rejects enrolment attempts when student already enrolled in the programme edition.


- **T4:** Test valid student enrolment in a course edition

Verify that the system successfully enrols a valid student in a selected programme edition and set of course edition when all
input data is correct and the enrolment conditions are met.


- **T5:** Test duplicate student enrolment in the same course edition

Ensure that the system prevents a student from being enrolled more than once in the same course edition and displays the
appropriate error or warning message.



### 10. Identified Risks

- Manual enrolment processes may introduce human errors if adequate validation checks are not implemented.

- Excessive enrolment could surpass available classroom or instructor capacity, leading to logistical challenges.



### 10. Conclusion

The enrolment of students in programme editions and their respective course editions is a critical aspect of academic administration.
This document formally defines the expected behavior and constraints of the process, ensuring that enrolments are executed in
a consistent, secure, and reliable manner. By addressing functional and non-functional aspects, along with potential risks,
this analysis supports the implementation of a robust solution that meets the needs of academic service staff while maintaining
data integrity and alignment with programme structures.
