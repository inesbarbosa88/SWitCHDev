# System Requirements and Specification 

## US05: As an Administrator, I want to register a department in the system

### 1. Introduction

This document presents the analysis for User Story 5, which outlines the requirements for allowing an administrator to register a department in the system.
The purpose is to ensure that administrators can create new departments with the necessary details and ensure proper validation and storage of the department information.

### 2. Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The system must support the entry of the department name.

**FR2**: The system must support the entry of the department acronym.

**FR3**: The system must validate that all required fields have valid values before allowing the department to be created. The validation must include:

The acronym must be a string containing only uppercase letters.

The department name must be a non-empty String, between 3 and 100 letters and should start with a capital letter (it must not have numbers or special characters). 

**FR4**: The system must check if the acronym or department name already exists in the repository before allowing the registration.

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements

There are no specific non-functional requirements imposed at this stage. 
However, it is essential to adhere to software design best practices such as encapsulation, clear code structure, and performance optimization.

### 4. Event Flow

- The administrator initiates the process by requesting to register a department in the system.

- The system asks the administrator to provide the department acronym.

- The administrator submits the acronym.

-  The system validates the entered data.
 
- The system requests the department name.

- The administrator submits the name.

- The system validates the entered data.

- If all data is valid, the system stores the department in the repository.

- The system responds with a success message, confirming that the department has been registered.

### 5. Acceptance Criteria

**AC1**: The system must prevent the registration of a department with a duplicate name or acronym.

**AC2**: The system must only allow acronyms with uppercase letters.

**AC3**: The system must only allow names with between 3 and 100 letters and that start with a capital letter.

### 6. Testing and Validation

**T1**: Test department registry with valid name and acronym
- Ensure that the system successfully registers a new department when given valid input for both the name and acronym.

**T2**: Test creation of multiple valid departments
- Verify that the system can register multiple distinct departments with different names and acronyms without any errors.

**T3**: Test department registration with duplicate name or acronym
- Ensure that the system rejects the creation of a department if the name or acronym already exists in the repository. 

**T4**: Test department creation with invalid department names
- Ensure that the system throws the correct exceptions when invalid names are provided, such as null, empty, or incorrectly formatted names.

**T5**: Test invalid department acronyms 
- Ensure that the system throws the correct exceptions when invalid acronyms are provided, such as null, empty, or incorrectly formatted acronyms.
