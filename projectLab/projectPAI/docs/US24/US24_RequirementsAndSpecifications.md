## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for User Story 24 (PAI project), covering:
- Functional and non-functional specifications
- Acceptance criteria
- Business rules
- Risk assessment
  The goal is to provide a structured foundation for implementation and quality assurance.

## 2. User Story Description
**User Role:** Academic Service Collaborator (ASC) 
**Objective:** Obtain the number of students currently enrolled in a specific Course Edition.

## 3. Functional Requirements
**FR1:** The system must allow ASCs to request the number of students enrolled in the specified Course Edition. 

**FR2:** Every Course Edition must be uniquely identified using a value object (CourseEditionID).

**FR3:** The system must accurately retrieve and return enrolment data.  

**FR4:** The response should include the total number of students enrolled.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
**NFR1:** Ensure data consistency in enrolment records.  

**NFR2:** Enable efficient queries even under concurrent access.  

**NFR3:** Maintain clean and scalable code following best practices. 

**NFR4:** Ensure quick response times, even for large datasets.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The system must return the correct number of students enrolled in the specified Course Edition.
- [ ] If no students are enrolled in the Course Edition, the system must return a count of 0.
- [ ] If the provided Course Edition ID does not exist or is invalid, the system must throw an appropriate exception with a meaningful error message.
- [ ] The system must not return incorrect or stale data when querying for enrolment counts.
- [ ] The system must ensure the ASC can only request the enrolment count for valid Course Editions.

## 6. Business Rules
- Each Course Edition must have a unique identifier.

## 7. Event Flow
1. ASC requests the student enrolment count.
2. The system prompts for the Course Edition identifier.
3. The ASC provides the identifier.
4. The system verifies the identifier.
5. The system retrieves the enrolment count.
6. The system returns the count to the ASC.
7. The UI displays the retrieved number.

## 8. Testing and Validation
- [ ] **Unit Tests:** Ensure that individual components (e.g., the controller, repository methods) are tested for expected behavior, including cases for valid and invalid Course Edition IDs.
- [ ] **Integration Tests:** Validate the interaction between the controller and repository layers, ensuring that the enrolment count is correctly retrieved from the data source.
- [ ] **Error Handling Validation:** Ensure that errors (such as invalid Course Edition IDs) are properly handled and communicated to the ASC with appropriate messages.
- [ ] **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Conduct UAT with ASCs to confirm that the feature meets the practical needs and expectations of the users.

## 9. Risk Analysis
| Risk Category  | Mitigation Strategy                     |  
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|  
| Data Integrity | Implement strict identifier validation  |  
| Performance    | Optimize database access for efficiency |  
| Usability   | Provide clear error messages and guidance to users    |  
| User Errors  | Ensure the system handles invalid inputs gracefully |  


## 10. Conclusion
This feature ensures:

✔ Accurate and consistent enrolment data retrieval.

✔ A secure and efficient system architecture.

✔ A straightforward user interaction.

#### Proper validation and testing will ensure successful implementation.
