## 1. Introduction
This document specifies the requirements for User Story 02 (PAI project), including:
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Acceptance criteria
- Business rules
- Risk analysis  
Providing a complete framework for development and quality assurance.

## 2. User Story Description
**Role:** System Administrator (Admin)  
**Requirement:** Ability to configure an Access Method in the system (create and register)

## 3. Functional Requirements
**FR1:** System shall enable Admins to configure an Access Method  
**FR2:** Each Access Method must have a unique name (value object)  
**FR3:** System must persist successfully created Access Method data  
**FR4:** System shall provide confirmation to Admin upon successful configuration

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
**NFR1:** Prevent duplicate Access Method configurations (data integrity)  
**NFR2:** Support concurrent configuration without data conflicts  
**NFR3:** Adhere to clean code, maintainability, and performance standards  
**NFR4:** Maintain fast response times during configuration process 

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Admin can configure Access Methods successfully
- [ ] Access Method must have a unique name
- [ ] System validates uniqueness before allowing creation
- [ ] System rejects invalid configuration attempts
- [ ] System prompts for correction of missing/incorrect data
- [ ] Persistent storage upon successful validation

## 6. Business Rules
- Uniqueness constraint: No duplicate Access Methods
- Mandatory field: Access Method name (Value Object)

## 7. Event Flow
1. Admin initiates Access Method configuration
2. System prompts for Access Method name
3. System validates uniqueness of name
4. On validation success:
    - Creates Access Method
    - Stores record
    - Confirms creation to Admin

## 8. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Creation with valid data
- [ ] Prevention of creation without mandatory field
- [ ] Duplicate entry prevention

## 9. Risk Analysis
| Risk Category  | Mitigation Strategy                        |  
|---------------|-------------------------------------|  
| Data Integrity | Implement uniqueness validation checks |  
| Performance    | Optimize concurrent transaction handling |  
| Scalability   | Design for increasing data volume |  
| Human Error   | Implement input validation and guidance |  


## 10. Conclusion
The solution ensures:  
✔ Data integrity through validation  
✔ Reliability via robust architecture  
✔ Usability with a guided configuration workflow

#### Risk mitigation and thorough testing will guarantee feature success.
