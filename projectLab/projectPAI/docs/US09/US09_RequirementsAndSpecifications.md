## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for User Story 09 (PAI project),
which handles a student enrolment in programmes, including:

- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Acceptance criteria
- Business rules
- Risk analysis
- Providing a complete framework for development and quality assurance.

## 2. User Story Description
**Role:** Academic Services Coordinator (ASC)  
**Requirement:** Ability to enrol a student in an academic programme

## 3. Functional Requirements
**1:** System should enable ASC to enrol a student in a programme  
**2:** System must validate all enrolment parameters (student, programme, access method, date)  
**3:** System must persist successful enrolments  
**4:** System will provide confirmation upon successful enrolment  
**5:** System will retrieve student, programme, and access method information by ID or name

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
**1:** Prevent duplicate or invalid enrolments (data integrity)  
**2:** Support concurrent enrolment operations without data conflicts  
**3:** Adhere to clean code principles and maintainability standards  
**4:** Maintain fast response times during enrolment process  
**5:** Robust parameter validation to prevent null values

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ASC can successfully enrol a student in a programme
- [ ] System validates all required parameters before enrolment
- [ ] System rejects enrolment attempts with missing/invalid data
- [ ] System persists enrolment data upon successful validation
- [ ] System can retrieve student, programme, and access method information
- [ ] System provides appropriate error messages for invalid operations

## 6. Business Rules
- All enrolment parameters must be non-null (student, programme, access method, date)
- Student must exist in the system before enrolment
- Programme must exist in the system before enrolment
- Access method must exist in the system before enrolment
- Enrolment date must be valid

## 7. Event Flow
1. ASC initiates student enrolment process
2. System retrieves:
    - Student information (by ID)
    - Programme information (by ID or name)
    - Access method information (by ID or name)
3. ASC provides enrolment date
4. System validates all parameters:
    - Checks for null values
    - Verifies existence of all entities
5. On validation success:
    - Creates enrolment record
    - Persists data to repository
    - Confirms successful enrolment to ASC

## 8. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Successful enrolment with valid data
- [ ] Prevention of enrolment with missing parameters
- [ ] Prevention of enrolment with non-existent entities
- [ ] Proper error handling for invalid operations
- [ ] Concurrent enrolment operations testing

## 9. Risk Analysis
| Risk Category  | Mitigation Strategy                        |  
|---------------|-------------------------------------|  
| Data Integrity | Implement comprehensive validation checks before enrolment |  
| Performance    | Optimize repository access and concurrent operations |  
| Data Consistency | Ensure transactional integrity for enrolment operations |  
| Human Error   | Implement robust input validation and clear error messages |  

## 10. Conclusion
This solution ensures:  
✔ Reliable student-programme enrolment process  
✔ Data integrity through comprehensive validation  
✔ Robust error handling and user feedback  
✔ Maintainable and scalable architecture

Thorough testing and risk mitigation strategies will ensure feature success.
