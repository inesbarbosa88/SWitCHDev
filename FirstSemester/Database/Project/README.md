# **Relational Data Model Project**

This repository contains the work for the relational data model development as part of the **DataBase** course. The project involves designing a relational model for a specific problem, implementing integrity constraints, creating tables, and inserting data in the database.

## **Group Members**
The project was developed by the following team members:
- **Ana Catarina Magalhães Conde**
- **Cláudio Alexandre Ferraz Cunha**
- **Fernando Júlio Araújo Moreira**
- **Inês Isabel Leal Barbosa**
- **João Pedro Gomes de Lemos Pinheiro**
- **Mélanie Audrey Gomes Barbosa**
- **Pedro Miguel Alves Soares**
- **Sérgio Fernando Pinto Ramos**

## **Project Overview**

### **Part I - Relational Data Model Development:**
1. **Relational Data Model**: We identified the entities, attributes, and relationships in the problem domain, ensuring that the model adheres to the **third normal form (3NF)**. We clearly defined the **primary and foreign keys**, as well as the **relationships** and **cardinalities** between entities. Non-trivial decisions regarding the design were fully justified.
2. **Integrity Constraints**: All integrity constraints that couldn’t be represented directly in the relational model were described and numbered for clarity.

### **Part II - Database Implementation:**
1. **Database Creation**: We created the **database tables** based on the relational data model, applying trivial restrictions such as **NRCC**, **email validation**, **minimum and maximum values**, and **default values**.
2. **Data Insertion**: We inserted a minimum of **30 tuples** into each table, ensuring sufficient test data for the database.

### **Part III - Report:**
- The **report** includes the following:
  - **Relational model diagram (image)**
  - **Queries developed** and their functions
  - **Screenshots** showing query results
  - **Conclusions and reflections** on the project

## **Tools Used**
- **Relational Model Design Tool**: **Lucidchart**
- **Database Management System (DBMS)**: **Oracle Live SQL**
