# Computer Systems and Networks
This repository contains study materials, exercises, and a project related to the implementation and understanding of TCP and UDP client-server programming.

### Objectives:
- Explain the hierarchy of abstractions and implementations that make up a modern computational system, and how they impact the performance and correctness of applications.
- Understand the structure and purpose of a conventional operating system.
- Understand the concept of virtualization and its use cases.
- Explain computer networks and the client-server model.
- Develop efficient and reliable software solutions based on the underlying computational system.

## Course Topics
The following topics were covered as part of the learning process, specifically in relation to the implementation of the TCP and UDP client-server programming project:

# 1. Fundamental Concepts of Computational Systems
# 2. Operating Systems
# 3. Virtualization
